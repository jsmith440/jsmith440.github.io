# About Me

Persevering, steadfast, & candor woman. In 2006, I graduated with an Associates of Applied Science Degree in Computer & Electronics Engineering. After graduating, my daughter and I moved to the Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas area for the many opportunities available. Most of my positions in Dallas were contract positions.After twelve years I decided to move back to ALbuquerque. Currently I am attending a Java & Android app Development Bootcamp that I will graduate from in April 3, 2020. My interests are cooking and listening/dancing to trance music. At this particular moment, my career goal is to finish bootcamp with a strong fundamental understanding of Java & Android Development.
